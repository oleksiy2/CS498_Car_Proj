In order to prevent loss of code or corruption of branches please follow the rules listed below.

We will be creating a new temporary branch for each time you work on something new.
These temp branches will be merged into the "test" branch once you are ready.
When we are ready we will merge the "test" branch into the "master" branch.
To merge into the "master" branch there needs to be two other people that approve the merge.
To merge into the "test" branch you do not need any approval. All code commited to the test branch should be fully working to the best of your knowledge.
Most testing should occure on the temp branches.

To start working on a new feature:
1. Create a new branch on GitHub.com by going to "Code", selecting the "branch" dropdown and typing in the name of your new branch (name it anything you want).
2. Next, go to Unity and "Fetch" the repository in the GitHub pannel.
3. In Unity go to "Branches" and double-click on the branch you have just created.
4. You can now work in this branch and make commits/pushes to this branch as you go.

5. Once you are ready to merge your changes into the test branch, commit your changes to your branch once more.
6. Push your changes to your branch.
7. Pull any new changes down from the test branch to avoid merge conflicts.

8. Go to the GitHub site and navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab.
9. Click on "New pull request".
10. Select the "test" branch on the left and your branch on the right.
11. Click "Create pull request".
12. Click "Create pull request" again.
13. Click "Merge pull request".
14. Finaly click "Confirm merge".
15. Your code should now be merged into the "test" branch.
16. You can delete the temp branch by clicking "Delete branch".
